Users can create, read, update, and delete recipes, each containing a title, ingredients, instructions, and cooking time. The application includes a search function to filter recipes by title. The frontend is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend is built with Python and Flask, using a PostgreSQL database for storage. User passwords are securely hashed, and data ownership is strictly enforced."

    "original_description": "Build a complete web application called \"RecipeKeep\" for managing a personal recipe collection where users can register for an account using an email and password and then log in to manage their own private recipes. Once authenticated, a user must be able to perform full CRUD operations on their recipes: create a new recipe with a title, a list of ingredients (as a single text block), step-by-step instructions, and an estimated cooking time in minutes; view a list of all their created recipes on a main dashboard; update the details of any of their existing recipes; and permanently delete a recipe. The main dashboard must also include a search bar that allows the user to filter their recipe list in real-time by typing keywords that match the recipe's title. For the technology stack, you must use a Python backend with the Flask framework and a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage, while the frontend should be built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive, clean, and intuitive single-page-application-style interface where content updates happen without full page reloads. Critically, all user passwords must be securely hashed before being stored, and the system must enforce strict data ownership, meaning a logged-in user can only ever view, edit, or delete their own recipes and never those created by other users.",
