The user should be able to create flashcards, search through their existing flashcards, review flashcards, and see statistics on flashcards reviewed. Preload ten cards containing a Hindi word or phrase and its English translation. Review interface: In the review interface, clicking or pressing Space should flip the card with a smooth 3-D animation to reveal the translation. Pressing the arrow keys should navigate through cards. Search interface: The search bar should dynamically provide a list of results as the user types in a query. Statistics interface: The stats page should show a graph of the number of cards the user has reviewed, and the percentage they have gotten correct. Create cards interface: The create cards page should allow the user to specify the front and back of a flashcard and add to the user's collection. Each of these interfaces should be accessible in the sidebar. Generate a single page React app (put all styles inline)."
