      "Assumption: 'Single user role.' - Reasonable for initial development. Simplifies access control during the initial phase. Roles like Admin, Project Manager, and Contributor may be added later as requirements evolve.",
      "Question: 'Are there different user roles with different permissions?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Initially, there is a single user role. However, the system should be designed with the flexibility to add different roles with varying permissions in the future. Potential roles to consider are Admin, Project Manager, and Standard User.",
      "Question: 'Are email or in-app notifications required?' - Answered with Medium confidence: While not initially required, implementing in-app notifications for task assignments, due date reminders, and status updates would significantly enhance user experience. Email notifications could be added later to cater to users who may not be actively using the application regularly.",
      "Question: 'Are there other collaboration features required (e.g., commenting, file attachments)?' - Answered with Medium confidence: These features are not initially required but are highly desirable for improved team collaboration and task clarity. Consider adding commenting and file attachments in a subsequent iteration.",
      "Question: 'Does the application need to integrate with other services?' - Answered with Low confidence: Initially, no external integrations are required. However, future integration possibilities should be considered during the design phase. Potential integrations could include calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook), communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams), and project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).",
      "Question: 'Are there any constraints on the technology stack to be used?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Without specific constraints, a common and widely supported stack such as a JavaScript framework (React, Angular, or Vue.js) for the front-end, a Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) backend, and a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL would be suitable. This stack provides flexibility, scalability, and a large pool of developers.",
      "Question: 'What is the expected number of users and projects?' - Answered with Low confidence: Without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific estimate. It's best to assume a low number initially (e.g., less than 100 users and 20 active projects) and design the application to be scalable as needed. This allows for handling growth without over-engineering the initial implementation.",
      "Question: 'Where will this be deployed (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, on-premise)?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Without explicit direction, deploying to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud is a reasonable choice, offering scalability, reliability, and managed services. AWS is a widely used and comprehensive platform. This should be validated with the client based on their resources and preferences. Dockerizing the application will assist with portability across different deployment environments."
