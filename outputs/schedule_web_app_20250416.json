      "Assumption: 'A simple user authentication and authorization are needed.' - This is reasonable for security and user management, even for personal use. This prevents unauthorized access to the application.",
      "Question: 'Are there different types of users (e.g., administrator, standard user, viewer) with different levels of access and permissions?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Initially, let's assume two roles: Administrator and Standard User. The Administrator can manage all aspects of the application, including user management and system settings. Standard Users can create, read, update, and delete their own scheduled events.",
      "Question: 'What kind of scheduling are we talking about? Is this for personal appointments, team meetings, resource allocation, shift scheduling, or something else?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Let's initially focus on personal appointments and simple team meetings. This will allow for individual event management and basic collaboration. We can expand to more complex scenarios like resource allocation or shift scheduling in later iterations.",
      "Question: 'Does the application need to support recurring events? If so, what level of complexity is required (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Yes, the application should support recurring events. Initially, let's support daily, weekly, and monthly recurrence options. Custom recurrence rules can be considered for a future release.",
      "Question: 'Should the app send reminders or notifications about upcoming scheduled events? If so, via what channels (email, SMS, in-app)?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Yes, the app should send reminders. Email is a good starting point due to its widespread accessibility. In-app notifications can be added later. SMS could be considered as a premium feature.",
      "Question: 'Should the app integrate with any existing calendars or other systems (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook)?' - Answered with Medium confidence: Integration with Google Calendar should be considered for a later phase, as it provides a convenient way for users to synchronize their existing schedules. Let's postpone this for the initial version to simplify development.",
      "Question: 'What views are required? (e.g. Day, Week, Month, Agenda).' - Answered with High confidence: The application should initially include Day, Week, and Month views. An Agenda view can be added in a later iteration.",
      "Question: 'Should the application support users from different timezones.' - Answered with High confidence: Yes, the application should support users from different timezones to ensure accurate scheduling for distributed teams or individuals. Events should be displayed and managed based on the user's local timezone.",
      "Question: 'How will users log in to the application? Will it be through the apps own authentication system, or a third party (e.g. Google, Facebook)' - Answered with Medium confidence: Initially, implement the application's own authentication system with username and password. Third-party authentication (e.g., Google) can be added later to improve user convenience."
