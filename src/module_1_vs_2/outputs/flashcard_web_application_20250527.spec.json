Statistics interface: The stats page should show a graph of the number of cards the user has reviewed, and the percentage they have gotten correct. Create cards interface: The create cards page should allow the user to specify the front and back of a flashcard and add to the user's collection. Each of these interfaces should be accessible in the sidebar. Generate a single page app (put all styles inline)."
